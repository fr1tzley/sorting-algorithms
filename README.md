# sorting-algorithms
A visual Swing application with implementations of 3 sorting algorithms, bubble, merge and quicksort. Each algorithm is written in Java code in a single sorter class, 
one instance of which is generated for the GUI. 

Within the GUI, the user can dynamically adjust the size of the list to be sorted with a slider or text area, and select different algorithms to use. Currently, only animations
for bubble sort are implemented.
